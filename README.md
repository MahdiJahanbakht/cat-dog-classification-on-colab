# Classic Cat-Dog Classification by transfer learning using Pytorch on Google Colab

This repo contains notebooks that walks you trough the process of transfer learning using pytorch and google colab backend step by step.

* part 0: Colab Memory Check, explains a common problem of out of memory problem, and introduces some solutions
* Part 1: Configuring Kaggle API, explains how to use Kaggle API via Google Colab
* Part 2: Make Daataset, Explains how to download one of the Kaggles many datasets directly into your Google Drive, and how to make a proper dataset inplace for our purpose
* Part 3: Transfer_Learning, Explains how to download a pre-trained model and runs a new learnig process to learn to classify our dataset
* Part 4: Loading checkpoints and Make Inferences or Resume Learning, Explains how to load checkpoints saved in the previous part and how ro resume your time consuming learning process after Google colab resets within 12 hours after openning each session, or just test it on some test data
